# Instructions

1. Complete the method `double averageArray(int[] list)`. This method has a parameter called `list` which is an array containing a list of integer values. The averageArray() method should compute and return the **mean** value as an `double` using all the numbers in the array. Your solution should work for any size of array. **(3 marks)**
> Using this array [1,2,3,4,5] the average would be 3.0
> Using this array [-6,7,8,9,0,3] the average would be 3.5

2. Complete the methods `int minValue(int [] list)` and `int maxValue(int [] list)` which take an array called `list` as input and return the minimum and maximum array values respectively. Your solution should work for any size of array.**(3 marks)**
> Using this array [-6,7,8,9,0,3] the min would be -6
> Using this array [-6,7,8,9,0,3] the max would be 9

3. Complete the method `int[] arrayMerge(int[] l1, int [] l2)`. This method takes as input 2 arrays which are concatenated (joined) and returns a new array. Your solution should work for any size of arrays.**(4 marks)**
> Using these arrays [1,2,3,4,5] and [-6,7,8,9,0,3]
> the result should be [1,2,3,4,5,-6,7,8,9,0,3]

4. Run the unit tests and check all tests pass before submitting your solution.
